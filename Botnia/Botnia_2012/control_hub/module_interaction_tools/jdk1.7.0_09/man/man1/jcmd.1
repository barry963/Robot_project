.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
.LP
\f3jcmd\fP is a utility to send diagnostic command requests to a Java Virtual Machine supporting this feature.
.LP
.LP
Used without arguments or with the \-l option, jcmd prints the list of running Java processes with their process id, their main class and their command line arguments.
.LP
.LP
When a process id is specified on the command line, jcmd sends the diagnostic command request to the process with this id.
.LP
.LP
When a main class is specified on the command line, jcmd sends the diagnostic command request to all Java processes for which the command line argument is a substring of the Java process' main class.
.LP
.LP
With the PerfCounter.print argument, jcmd prints the performance counters available on the targeted Java process(es).
.LP
.LP
With the \-f option, jcmd sends to the targeted Java process(es) the diagnostic commands stored in the file \f2file\fP.
.LP
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP
.LP
Options are mutually exclusive. Options, if used, should follow immediately after the command name.

\-l 
Prints the list of running Java processes with their process id, their main class and their command line arguments.

\-h 
Prints a help message.

\-help 
Prints a help message.

.SH "PARAMETERS"
.LP
.RS 3
.TP 3
pid 
Identifies the process that receives the diagnostic command requests. The process must be a Java process. To get a list of Java processes running on a machine, use jps(1) or jcmd(1). 
.TP 3
main class 
Main class of the process that receives the diagnostic command requests. When matching processes, any process whose main class name contains the specified string as a substring will be matched. If several running Java processes share this main class, the diagnostic command request is sent to all these processes. To get a list of Java processes running on a machine, use jps(1) or jcmd(1). 
.TP 3
command [arguments] 
Invoke the diagnostic command called \f2command\fP on the targeted Java process(es). The list of available diagnostic commands for a given process can be obtained by invoking the \f3help\fP command on this process. Each diagnostic command has its own set of \f2arguments\fP, which can be obtained by invoking the the command name followed by \f3help\fP. 
.TP 3
PerfCounter.print 
Print the performance counters available on the targeted Java process(es). The list of performance counters may vary with the Java process. 
.TP 3
\-f file 
Read commands from \f2file\fP and invoke them on the targeted Java process(es). In \f2file\fP, each command must be written on a single line. Lines starting with # are ignored. Processing of \f2file\fP ends when all lines have been invoked or when a line containing the \f3stop\fP keyword is read.

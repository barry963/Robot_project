About Project
===============

What is UliPad
-------------------

UliPad is a General Python Editor based on Python and wxPython. It supports many features that you can 
find in other Editors, and the main feature of it is flexible mixin and plugin architecture. So user
can extend his own functionality into UliPad, and you can treat UliPad as a developing platform.

How to find & download it
----------------------------

For now, UliPad is hosted on code.google.com site, you can find it at http://code.google.com/p/ulipad . 
You can download the lastest version of UliPad at here_. And the svn url is: 

http://ulipad.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

.. _here: http://code.google.com/p/ulipad/downloads/list

How do I get the newest source code from SVN
----------------------------------------------

There are a couple of free programs that make this extremely easy.
Windows users should get TortoiseSVN http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/.
Others should get RapidSVN http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/. And there is 
also pysvn-workbench http://pysvn.tigris.org/docs/WorkBench.html written by python.

This FAQ will explain the use of TortoiseSVN.

Once TortoiseSVN has been installed:

If you have yet to install Ulipad, create a new, empty folder for it.

The following apply whether you have yet to install Ulipad, or are
updating it with TortoiseSVN for the first time:

#. Right-click within your Ulipad folder to show the context menu.
#. Note the two menu entries, SVN Checkout, and TortoiseSVN.
#. Click on SVN Checkout. This will call TortoiseSVN.
#. Enter http://ulipad.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ in
   the "URL of repository" box.
#. The Checkout directory should already show the folder you created
   for Ulipad, for example, `C:\Program Files\Ulipad`.
#. Do not check "Only check out the top folder" or "Omit externals".
#. Select the "HEAD revision" radio button. This will ensure you get
   the latest revision. (Should you want an earlier revision for some
   reason, select the "Revision" button and enter the revision number)
#. Click OK. The download will begin. When finished, you're ready to use Ulipad!

The second and subsequent times you update Ulipad using TortoiseSVN:

#. Right-click within your Ulipad folder to show the context menu.
#. Click on SVN Update and leave the rest to TortoiseSVN!

Hints:

#. Before updating, you may want to backup your Ulipad folder.
#. Always make a note of the number of latest revision you have.
#. http://ulipad.googlecode.com/svn/ will show the
   number of the latest revision available. Or using `svn update` to see 
   the lastest revision.
#. Keep up-to-date by subscribing to the Ulipad mailing list at
   http://groups.google.com/group/ulipad.

Starting UliPad
==================

What's DDE
------------------

DDE is dynamic data exchange, this functionality is only existed in window platform. But in UliPad, it
uses socket to simulate this function. And UliPad will use it to keep one instance, and when you start
UliPad with filename parameter, then the second instance will transfer the filename to the first one, 
then the file will be opened in the first instance.

How to set DDE port
----------------------

Default, UliPad will bind 50000 port to DDE socket, but sometimes this port may be used by others, so
you could not use DDE. So you can change the default DDE port in config.ini. Just write down below code
in config.ini::

	[server]
	port=50001
	
How to disable DDE
---------------------

Sometimes you may don't want to use DDE, so you can start UliPad with `-n` option::

    python UliPad.py -n

Usage
========

How to use code folding
--------------------------

Author: Dick Moores

#. Enable code folding by checking "Show code folding margin" on Edit
   -> Preferences, the Document tab.
#. Click on a "-" to fold. "+" to expand.
#. Ctrl+Shift+Left-Click anywhere in folding margin will toggle
   between Fold All and Expand All.

How to create snippets
------------------------

Author: Dick Moores

A snippet is usually some bit of code that you want to keep handy for
repeated use. Within Ulipad it can be inserted into your code with
just a double-click on the snippet's abbreviation in a list of
snippets in the Snippets Window.

See the `Snippets How-to`_

.. _`Snippets How-to`: howto_snippet.htm

Please explain the Edit->Format menu
----------------------------------------------

Author: Dick Moores

The top 4 items, ("Trim Trailing Spaces", "Leading Spaces To Tabs",
"Leading Tabs To Spaces", "ALL Tabs To Spaces"):

#. Before using any of these four, it's a good idea to click on View
   -> Tabs and Spaces to make the space/tab marks visible.
#. Select the lines you want to change and then click on the menu item
   you want to use.
#. If you want to change only one line, just position the caret
   anywhere on that line. Selecting the line is not necessary.
#. If you want the change to affect all lines in the document,
   `Ctrl+Alt` of course will select them all.
#. When converting spaces to tabs, if the number of leading
   consecutive spaces in a line is not a multiple of the tab width you
   set in Edit -> Preferences -> Document (e.g., 10 spaces and tab width
   4), not all the spaces will be converted to tabs (for the example, 8
   spaces will become 2 tabs, leaving 2 spaces unchanged).

Increase and Decrease Indent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Select the lines you want to affect.
#. Use the Tab key to Increase Indent (or click on the menu item).
#. Use Shift+Tab to Decrease Indent (or click on the menu item).

Comment Line and Uncomment Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Select the lines you want to affect. If only one line, just
   position the caret anywhere on that line.
#. Use `Ctrl+/` to Comment the line(s) (or click on the menu item). This
   puts a "#" at the head of each line.
#. Use `Ctrl+\\` to Uncomment the line(s) (or click on the menu item).
   This deletes the "#" at the head of each line.
#. For documents in languages that use different comment characters
   from "#", it's handy to enable "Show comment character dialog when
   adding comment", on the Document tab in  Preferences.


Text Quote and Unquote
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Select the text you want to enclose in quotes.
#. `Ctrl+'` (or clicking on the menu item) will show the Quote Char Select dialog.
#. Select the radio button for the quote characters you want and hit Enter.
#. To Unquote, select the text to unquote plus its quote characters.
#. `Ctrl+Shift+'` (or clicking on the menu item) will show the Quote
   Char Select dialog.
#. Select the radio button for the quote characters and hit Enter.
#. If you usually use the same quote characters, it may be convenient
   to define those characters in the dialog box, and check the "User
   Define Quote Char" box.

What is config.ini used for
------------------------------

config.ini is a configure file of UliPad, default it'll be not existed. Some functionality will 
automatically create config.ini. And if there is no such file, you can create manually.

More details about it you can see `Config Description`_ .

.. _`Config Description`: config.htm

What is debug.txt used for
------------------------------

It's debug log of UliPad, UliPad will write some debug information into this file, for example:
menu infos, toolbar infos, preference infos, etc. So you can use it to get some information of UliPad.

What is error.txt used for
------------------------------

It's error log file. If there are errors when running UliPad, it'll write error message into this file.

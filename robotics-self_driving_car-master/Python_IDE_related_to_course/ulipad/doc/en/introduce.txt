INTRODUCTION
------------

This item is a personal project development objective is to design and develop a convenient and flexible Python editor, on the one hand to have independent copyright, on the other hand may be required
When the realization of the special features customization needs.

Objective
News

This document to help users of the project background, function, the scope of understanding and respect for rational, and effective use of the item.

Introduction
Ape

UliPad is an editor, you can use it to carry out your document writing, programming development. It uses Python programming language development, user interface-based scripting
. In addition to the completion of the general editor commonly used features, the most important thing is to realize a convenient, flexible framework, developers can easily develop new features. But
Programming experience with the users can also address the daily work of the special problems of handling plug-ins, allowing them their own day-to-day work and closely integrated. The use of the
This powerful Python programming language, you can easily make changes to the software to meet their own needs.

GPL version of this software is released manner, and I welcome your exchange.


Project history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, the predecessor of the item should be FlyEdit (from the Italian word for the hovercraft, is to achieve freedom extended). The first is the use of scripting, but then the scripting wxStyledTextCtrl
Components (yes Scintilla editor packets - a powerful editor - the scripting package) is not perfect, when using multiple files when (then want to use to achieve more documents) will have problems,
Therefore waive scripting. Then to the Tcl / Tkinter (also a cross-platform graphics package, but limited control, some trouble in Chinese), has achieved Mixin mechanism, but also
Allows users to prepare their own plug-ins. It is based on the Python IDLE to the transit, syntax highlighted features such as the use of Python to achieve, not Tcl / Tkinter itself all
Functional, the efficiency is very slow. And many editors do not have the function, it is very troublesome to achieve. Plus later in the Linux testing, running mistakes, so it
Abandoned.

In April 2004, I discovered DrPython freshmeat.net, it is an editor, use scripting 2.4.2.3.2.3 (now upgraded to 2.5.1), and realized
Multi-document (using wxNotebook and wxStyledTextCtrl components), and function very well, and I made some suggestions to improve, and later become a developer, and
Its revised and implemented some features. But with the huge software, the amendment has become increasingly difficult. Because one of the new features may have to revise the menu, dialog parameters, incident handling code
Etc., but these places are not together, but spread open, such rewriting procedures to be several places at the same time, very troublesome. And another person is not clearly know you
What has changed in the end, might better than several procedures to know what changed. But if you also amend a number of functions, the results of this comparison may be several functional mixed
Together, the changes look very inconvenient.

After a period of time right DrPython changes and learning, I am now very stable scripting (Borland also said he wants to C + + Builder X used as a graphics wxWindow
Development House, in view of this wxWindow or promising), want to achieve a flexible programming framework, in particular to use Python is a powerful dynamic characteristics, and Xu
Many new things can be in developing applications can learn a lot of scripting knowledge. So I started a new project development. To distinguish FlyEdit, I call for UliPad, Italy
"Freshmen editors."

UliPad project in 2004, officially began on April 22 coding, after carefully considering the framework. Now it uses two basic structure: Mixin and Plugin. The difference between the two in my blog
In a careful distinction. Simply put, both of which are right for the expansion of the mechanism is to increase Mixin new members and the members of variables, and Plugin is a special procedure set
Call processing plug-in points (a bit like a callback function or pseudo-events). So, I first of a class based on the available when the realization of a new function, the use of the new mechanism will function Mixin joined the
Category. The category needs special treatment, the default insertion sites (call may not know what they need only definition of the parameters interface can be imported), and then insert the need to insert a new code points
, The use of Plugin mechanisms to achieve. Because more than one procedure may need to expand the category, probably a lot of categories, and therefore Mixin Plugin mechanism, also joined the interface Recognition gong
That, in other words: Mixin and Plugin allows for the reunification of the Mixin from a derivative of, and the only definition Mixin name for the distinction between different types Mixin. New or Mixin
Plugin need to use a function to insert itself into the corresponding category, the need to provide the name inserted Mixin. This allows Mixin Mixin like to be kind and the content can counterparts
Up. (More details please refer to the contents of "technical manuals")

In version 3.3, UliPad renamed UliPad.

Creative Thinking
------------------

Software development is a very painful thing, the demand for a large number of new and existing software architecture is the result of conflict between the software difficult to maintain a major reason. Very
More software may structure at the beginning of a very good, easy expansion, but with the rich software, code, the structure may be becoming no longer fit
Demand for new development. For editing software, such issues become even more obvious. Then UliPad is how to structure a flexible structure Jin
A useful to explore, it will become a professional, stable editing software. Therefore, UliPad core of the design is how to structure a
Species flexible architecture, the new features make it more convenient and more easy maintenance.

UliPad use of the software is based on Python + scripting. Therefore, UliPad Python can fully enjoy the dynamic character of the benefits of the same
When the use of the scripting, but also the realization of cross-platform operation.

Thus, the design concept is UliPad take full advantage of the dynamic characteristics of the Python language, structure and easy to expand flexible software system. Specific Technology
Mixin and that the use of Plugin Design and Development, France is distributed more put it in simple terms of programming, or narrowly interpreted as a plug-in program
(Distributed category but programming and plug-in programming is different, including the distribution of programming and Mixin Plugin, and generally include only programming plug-Plugin, plug-in programming
The expansion is functional limitations). Sometimes simple to, I will call for the distribution of programming Mixin, specifically the technical details, and will be broken down Mixin Plugin.

For example, or a software prototype has just begun, with only a few functions. Therefore, there will be some function of the foundation class. When these basic functions stability, the same
When a new demand, then need to expand these categories. There are two basic expansion:

  1. New methods, attributes the realization
  2. Increase the new method, called attributes of the entrance

Not for the adoption of a new method of the attribute may also need to add a new category. At this time the existing categories can be used to achieve the second expansion of the original and new
The link between categories.

Know the extension, then where to achieve? For the first expansion of a species, my method is the basic fixed category of the original document, but rather to create a
The new document, in this new document in a new way, attribute. Then through a mechanism of the new methods and attributes of a fusion with the target, while the melting
When it is running in a realized. This is a function of the development, and continuously expand. The new expansion is not directly in the original
A revised document, and a document simultaneously on a number of expansion, it is relatively easy to know that this expansion has done what work,
In software maintenance is very convenient. These extensions will be through a mechanism in the software runs automatically and objectives of fusion, no need for additional work. For
Such an extension, I called for the expansion of Mixin. For the first two kinds of expansion, I was in the original category corresponding increase in the call interface, while expanding Mixin
The increase in the interface called a concrete realization, which will be added by calling the interface function and the type of link. I called for such an extension for Plugin expansion
Also called a plug-in expansion.

Therefore Mixin expansion of the main development objectives of the extended functionality, such as adding new categories, such changes, add new attributes. For Plugin
Expansion of the main objectives is the need to find suitable locations call, a call to the corresponding definition of interface. At the same time achieve concrete Plugin code.

Project Overview

Function
News
This software is an editor, it is mainly applied to software development, especially the development of the Python language, but because of its flexible structure, so you can
Plug-in the preparation of applications to expand its functions. The editor of the development aims to improve the efficiency of the development programmer, it has many features in the operating close
The function.

Features
- - - - - -

Mixins are based on the software developed by the idea, many of the features you may need to disable, and will not affect the entire software. It is precisely because
This flexible editing framework, the development and maintenance are relatively easy. In the framework of this program you can extract out with the development of other projects.

It also is an international software automatically identifies the coding system used to display the corresponding local language. Currently supports Chinese and English. In its
Text of support particularly good.

The project organization and management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This personal project. The project, established in the http://www.tigris.org http://http://UliPad.tigris.org/ space for the project,
The entire project management software using CVS version management. Famous domestic and Python communities - Woodpecker communities (http://www.woodpecker.org.cn)
Create a wiki pages, release of information and user feedback.

Main characteristics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following list of UliPad now with the main characteristics of some other editor is not available. New features are constantly increasing:

Many syntax highlighted
   Now Python support, Html, C / C + + syntax highlighted

Python category View
   Python can browse the class structure

Python operating procedures
   The editor can run directly Python procedures to check the results. Set running path, setting running command line parameters.

Expansion term election
   Can '. 'As part of the word choice.

Matching choice
   Can Object () () [] \ '\' \ "\" of the text to include a choice. If a text is to use (), including up will be inserted into points in brackets, the selection, brackets
   Of all things being selected. If there are nested parentheses other brackets, they can choose a priority direction of matching choice left or right direction matching priority choice for this also nested parentheses
   Can handle.

Expanding choices
   In the selected text, the implementation of this function can be selected area about expansion. Matching the functional fit and function with the use of choice. End choice in the use of matching function, then
   You chose in brackets, but was not chosen their own brackets, the use of options to expand the brackets can be selected.

Replication
   Increased many replication. Some ideas from the Vim in the past. Importing text, very likely to be copied before importation. Thus, you can import only the first few letters and then
   Duplicate functions (including characters, words and phrases), so that from the time before the beginning of the text of the search at the first input consistent with the current text (which may be words or phrases), in the present -
   Purchase a hint that window, you may continue to achieve the implementation of alternative words or phrases around the pan. When the contents can be replicated to find the input current round will be filled importation. Importation of great convenience.

The text surrounding the
   Text can be selected, including the use of certain characters, such as (),{}. Some definition is good, if not, then you can use the user-defined strings.

Direct View
   General editor of the first search function can be selected to identify the contents, then open the View dialog box, then select the content that is just emerging in the inquiry dialog box, then the search
   The search can be carried out. But sometimes inconvenient, so NewEit F4 keys provided by the selected content directly to search, the search will not open the dialog box.

Jump to the last change
   UliPad can remember where the last change. When the inspection procedures have changed from the place, the use of this function can be directly jump back to just turn over the place.

Code fragments
   The text can be saved as repetitive code fragment, the need will be inserted in the document.

Ftp function
   Can a remote site on the paper Ftp: open, edit, preserve, delete, rename, in the new document, the new directory, upload, under Chuan.

Blog Editor
   Joined by a blog can easily plug-in for blog writing.

Text to Html
   Support reStructuredText -> html, python source -> html, textile -> html

Built-in viewer Html
   Html can use built-in viewer to browse Html (in Windows is to use IE)

Wizard function
   Users can customize modules of code automatically apply the framework and code generated automatically.

Contents View
   To open one or more directories on the left column for the paper for editing, browsing and switching.

Automatic expansion
   According to the importation of additional content automatically replaced, and so is the search function.

UliPad EditPlus is basically in accordance with the functions to be achieved, I think joined the program in a very convenient function. So some function and EditPlus is similar,
No longer described in more detail please refer to the "user manual."

Role of
~~~~~~~~~~~

The software is cross-platform software, simple installation and configuration. As can be run on Windows, Mac, Linux environment, as well installation can run Python and the scripting
Software. Also under Windows executable installation procedures provide a user-friendly installation. To install some third-party plug-ins, you need to install the plug-in to its corresponding
It packages.

Project development platform and tools
---------------------------------------

The software is cross-platform. Early in the project is the use of general text editing tools, the project must have become functional after the development, which own their own development.

Application areas
------------------

For document editing, software development. When developed a special plug-in functions can also be used after other purposes, such as: listen to MP3 blog editing, file format conversion (of these have been
Should the plugin).
